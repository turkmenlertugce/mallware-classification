Suppose a company is struggling with a series of computer virus attacks for the past several months. The viruses were grouped into a few types with some effort. 
However, it takes a long time to sort out what kind of virus it is when been hit with. Thus, the goal is to classify the virus as quickly as possible. There is a dataset of the features that may be handy (or not), 
and  also the associated virus type (target variable). 

The practice involves experimenting with various classification methods and applying best practices such as grid search, cross-validation, and feature selection/extraction techniques. 
Then, determining the method that yields the best results.
